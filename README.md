## Author: Jake Zhu
---
This repository presents a few of the components we have learned in our class taught by Dr. Randy Davila at University of Houston - Downtown for the semester of Fall 2020. 

### Projects:
The following topics are covered in this repository as part of the learning environment so far:
- Classical Perceptron Learning (Supervised)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (Supervised)

### Course Description: 
This senior level data science course blends the predictive perspective of statistical pattern recognition together with the algorithmic perspectives of  machine learning. Topics include,  but  are  not  limited  to: 

**The Components of Learning**
 - Supervised Learning
 - Unsupervised Learning
 - Semisupervised Learning
 - Feasibility of Learning
 - Measuring Error

**Supervised Learning**
 - Linear Regression
 - The K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
 - Decision Trees and Regression Trees
 - Gradient Descent & Logistic Regression
 - The Perceptron Learning Algorithm
 - Neural Nets
 
**Unsupervised Learning**
 - Clustering 
 - The K-Means Clustering Algorithm
 - Hierarchical Clustering
 - Probabilistic Clustering 
 - Autoencoding 
 
 
 ## Prerequisite Programming Languages 
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) versions 3.6 and higher 
- [Julia](https://julialang.org/) versions 1.0 and higher
